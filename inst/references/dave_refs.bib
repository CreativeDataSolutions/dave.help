  abstract = {SUMMARY: Interactive modules for Data Exploration and Visualization
	(imDEV) is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet embedded application providing
	an integrated environment for the analysis of omics data through
	a user-friendly interface. Individual modules enable interactive
	and dynamic analyses of large data by interfacing R's multivariate
	statistics and highly customizable visualizations with the spreadsheet
	environment, aiding robust inferences and generating information
	rich data visualizations. This tool provides access to multiple comparisons
	with false discovery correction, hierarchical clustering, principal
	(PCA) and independent component analyses (ICA), partial least squares
	regression (PLS) and discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), through an intuitive
	interface for creating high quality two and a three-dimensional visualizations
	including scatter plot matrices, distribution plots, dendrograms,
	heat maps, biplots, trellis biplots and correlation networks.Availability
	and Implementation: Freely available for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/imdev/.
	Implemented in R and VBA and supported by Microsoft Excel (2003,
	2007 and 2010). CONTACT: John W. Newman - John.Newman@ars.usda.gov
	SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Installation instructions, tutorials,
	and users manual are available at http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/imdev.}

  abstract = {Cytoscape is an open source software project for integrating biomolecular
	interaction networks with high-throughput expression data and other
	molecular states into a unified conceptual framework. Although applicable
	to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape
	is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of
	protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly
	available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core
	provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to
	visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes,
	and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases
	of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward
	plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational
	analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins
	are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating
	with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved
	in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional
	interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed
	stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},
